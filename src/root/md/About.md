# git-Llab

## About

A simple yet dynamic web project built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.  
This project is focused on learning and showcasing core front-end development skills — from layout and styling to interactivity and DOM manipulation.

This project serves as a hands-on learning environment to:

- Practice responsive web design using CSS Flexbox and Grid

- Implement interactive features using plain JavaScript

- Learn best practices in code structure and organization

- Understand DOM manipulation, event handling, and basic animations

Whether you’re viewing this as a learning tool or a foundation for a larger web app, the goal is to build solid skills in front-end development fundamentals.
