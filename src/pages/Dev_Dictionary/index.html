                    <p>
                        Buffer overflow is a type of software vulnerability that occurs when a program writes more data into a buffer than it can hold. This can lead to the corruption of adjacent memory, potentially causing the program to behave unexpectedly or even allowing malicious code to be executed.

                        In software development, a bug refers to an error, flaw, or defect in a program that causes it to behave unexpectedly or produce incorrect results. Bugs can range from minor issues to critical problems that prevent the software from functioning properly. Debugging is the process of identifying and fixing bugs in a program.
