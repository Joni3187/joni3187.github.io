                        In programming, a binary operator is an operator that operates on two operands (values or variables). Common binary operators include addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), division (/), and comparison operators (e.g., == for equality, < for less than).

                        In object-oriented programming (OOP), a class is a blueprint or template for creating objects. It defines the properties (attributes) and behaviors (methods) that objects of the class will have. Classes serve as a model for creating instances or objects.

                        A Command Line Interface is a text-based interface for interacting with a computer program or operating system. Users input commands through a terminal or console to perform tasks, often without a graphical user interface (GUI).
